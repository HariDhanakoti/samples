Don’t be comfortable.
Do something that scares you today.
You never know where it could lead.
Take risks, be open to change and stop talking about what you want.
Instead go get it! Don’t dream, do!
Don’t take no for an answer.
Keep your eyes wide open, see where this takes you.
What opportunities are created as a result of your open mind.
Take care of your self. Self care is important.
Take the time to learn new things, learning is important.
Be helpful. Inspire others. Be inspiring.
